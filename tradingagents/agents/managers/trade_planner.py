Analyze the following market report and investment plan to determine the optimal stop-loss and take-profit levels. You should use the available tools to get the latest market data and calculate technical indicators.

**Market Report:**
{market_report}

**Investment Plan:**
{investment_plan}

Use technical indicators such as Pivots, ATR, support and resistance levels, Donchian Channels, SuperTrend, etc., as well as risk factors to determine the stop-loss and take-profit levels.

If the user already has an open position (user_position = {user_position}) and existing management levels (stop_loss={existing_sl}, take_profit={existing_tp}), evaluate whether to keep, tighten, widen, trail, or remove them. Only change existing levels if your analysis strongly supports it. If no position is open, propose initial levels suitable for a new trade.

Based on your analysis, provide the stop-loss and take-profit levels in a JSON format. For example:
{{
    "stop_loss": 150.00,
    "take_profit": 180.00
}}

The stop-loss level is mandatory. The take-profit level is optional.
Do not provide any other information or explanation.
